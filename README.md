**Note: This project is no longer under development. It's been a great run, and Foli Client has become so much more than I possibly dreamed of. That being said, with the shutdown of TG, now feels like a good time to retire this project. Thank you to everyone who used and contributed to Foli Client throughout the past 8 months.**

## What is Foli Client?

Foli Client is a customized, preconfigured modpack intended to provide players with useful tools for technical Minecraft. In addition, mods are configured by default to be legal on the TeenagersGaming Minecraft Server. Here is an explanation of some of the various mods included:

## Build From Source

If you don't want to trust an executable from a rando on the internet, and would rather build it yourself from source, install PyInstaller from pip, navigate to the cloned repo, then run `pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=Icon32.ico --add-data "resources;resources" FoliClientInstaller.py` (Windows) or `pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=Icon32.ico --add-data "resources:resources" FoliClientInstaller.py` (MacOS/Linux). These are the same commands used to generate the latest binaries I distribute.

## Support me?

If (unlike me), you aren't a semi-broke student, maybe toss me a little crypto so I can achieve my lifelong dream of owning a maid outfit?
